This Bayesian final project was on Eliud Kipchogeâ€™s sub 2 hour marathon.

Data: https://github.com/hmelberg/berlin-marathon

Eliud Kipchoge made history by running a marathon in less than 2 hours. However, this was not done during a normal marathon and Kipchoge had spotters to help him keep pace. This analysis explores how likely it would be for someone like Kipchoge to run a sub 2 hour marathon during a competitive race.

We decided to use the marathon times from the 2013 Berlin marathon.  

The dependend variable is netTime.

The independed variables of interest are:
- age
- region
- sex

A bayesian linear model was $\beta$
