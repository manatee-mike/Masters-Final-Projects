This data origionated from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vetrirah/ml-iot).

The sensor data from the first 3 junctions were analyzed. Most of the model fitting was performed with the [auto.arima](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/forecast/versions/8.18/topics/auto.arima) function. 
After creating initial time series functions correlations were looked at between the junctions and models were created that used data  from the other junctions.
